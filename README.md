The Communication Theory final lab project involves simulating a communication block. The goal is to design and analyze various components of the communication system, including a sampler, quantizer, encoder, decoder, source, channel, and more.

The project tasks include:
  1. Creating a function to sample a sinusoidal signal with a given frequency.
  2. Designing a uniform quantizer to quantize the sampled values into different levels.
  3. Calculating the mean absolute quantization error and variance of the quantization error for different levels of quantization.
  4. Plotting the mean absolute quantization error, variance of the quantization error, and Signal-to-Quantization-Noise Ratio (SQNR) against the number of levels.
  5. Implementing an encoder using Huffman coding to compress the quantized values.
  6. Simulating a noiseless channel for transmission.
  7. Implementing a decoder to reverse the encoding scheme and recover the original signal.
  8. Using a Huffman decoder to decode the compressed signal.
  9. Plotting the input and output signals for comparison.
  10. Discussing ways to enhance the approximation of the output signal and explaining the difference between the input and output signals.
  11. Calculating the efficiency of the compression code and the compression rate.

The project requires writing MATLAB code and generating output figures.

The project provides an opportunity to gain practical experience in simulating a communication system, analyzing quantization errors, understanding compression techniques, and evaluating the performance of the system.
